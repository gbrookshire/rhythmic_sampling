- Payment form

## Subject ID computerized form
- Enter subject ID onto recording computer
- Last name: Date
- First name: Random code generated by computer

## HPI coils
- Affix HPI cable with a tape on the subjectâ€™s shoulder
- Attach the coils
  - Ignore the yellow one
- Put googles on
- Turn on Polhemus Fastrak
- Click button "Change" (HPI) in the acquisition machine
- Click button "Coordinates alignment"
- Start digitizing LEFT, NASION, RIGHT (make sure the difference is less than 5 mm)
- Digitize HPI coils (as program suggests)
  - Hold the stylus away from the participant for the 5th one
- Click button "Pen", cover the pen nose and digitize about 200 points
  - Head from front to back (5 lines)
  - Head from left to right (5 lines)
  - Forehead from left to right
  - Bridge of nose, and under the nose
  - Beneath eyes

## EOG & EKG
- Set VU and VL (e.g., green), HR and HL (e.g., blue).
- Set EKG electrodes on the top chest (L and R (e.g., red)).
- Set ground on the forehead or cheek (e.g., yellow)
- No reference

# Run experiment
## Subject enters MEG room
- Plug in HPI
- Plug in EOG/EKG
  - Vertical: BIO001
  - Horizontal: 002
  - EKG: 003
  - Ground: 004
- Give participant the LEFT button box
- Eye-tracker: set up on table between screen and subject
- Attach photodiode with small piece of tape
- Test intercom -- constant monitoring
- Start the script
- Calibrate eye-tracker
  - ENTER: Camera view
    - Focus on the **left** eye.
  - C: Calibrate
  - V: Validate
  - ESC: Exit calibration
- Go through instructions

## Data collection
- Check data quality, note down on the info sheet
  - Ask subject to blink and move eyes
  - Check MEG and EOG data quality
  - Open/Close jaw to look for fillings
  - Deep breaths
  - Alpha
- Start experiment in psychopy
- Start a new recording file on each block of trials
  - Click 'Go'
  - **Check 'record raw'**
  - **Check 'cHPI' for a few seconds, then uncheck it.**
- File naming:
  - 0: QUEST procedure
  - 1-3: main experiment recordings
- During data collection
  - Check photo-diode recording
  - Check triggers (stimuli & responses)

# Powering down
- Inverse of turning things on

# Back up data
- `cd /data/neuro-data/<PROJECT_DIR>/`
- `scp -r <SUBJECT_NAME> brookshg@bluebear.bham.ac.uk:/rds/projects/2017/...`

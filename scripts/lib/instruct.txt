In this study, you'll see faces appear on the screen for several seconds at a time.
Your job is press the button as fast as you can whenever a small dot flashes on one of the faces. This might look like faint mole that flashes very briefly on the face.
These dots will start off fairly easy to see, but it will get more difficult as the experiment goes on.
Dots will not appear on every trial.
While the faces are on the screen, it's important to avoid blinking, and to keep your eyes on the white dot in the middle of the screen.
You'll get a brief break once every few seconds. The white dot tells you that faces will appear soon. Be sure to keep your eyes on that white dot!
There will be a longer break once every few minutes.

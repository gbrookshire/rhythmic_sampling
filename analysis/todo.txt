- Artifacts
    - Go over manual artifact rejection again
        - After previous rounds (and after ICA)
    - Eye movements
- Analyses
    - Look for coherence: alpha --> freq tagging
        - Replicate Spaak et al (2012) (as close as is possible)
    - Ratio of power in hits/misses
        - Power timecourse
        - HP filter, then cut out transient, then maybe Z-score
        - Pow(63) / Pow(78) -- look at this ratio as a function of time
        - Compare hits vs misses
    - Establish rhythmic sampling
        - Look into reproducing the analyses from Landau et al (2015)?
    - Does low-freq phase correlate with accuracy?
        - Consider using Phase-consistency metric from Landau et al (2015)
    - Does power at each tagged frequency vary rhythmically?
        - FFT or autocorrelation of each power time-course
    - How does power at the two tagged frequencies covary?
        - Factor out overall changes in excitability, maybe by looking at the difference between the two hemispheres?

- Micro-saccades?
    - Check EyeLink traces
    - Check EOG

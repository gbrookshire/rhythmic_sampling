- Artifacts
    - Go over manual artifact rejection again
        - After previous rounds (and after ICA)
    - Eye movements
-ROI
    - Use RESS/GEDb based on 63Hz
      - RESS/GEDb - implemented. Works well for 63 Hz, very poorly for 78 Hz due to weak signal.
      - Use spatial filters from 63 Hz for both frequencies. For participants who have clean filters for both frequencies, the filters look almost identical.
    - Comparison of spatial filter methods:

        - GEDb seems to be the best, especially for shorter recordings (fig 4D)

- Analyses
    - Establish rhythmic sampling
        - Look into reproducing the analyses from Landau et al (2015)?
    - Does low-freq phase correlate with accuracy?
        - Replicate Fiebelkorn et al (2018)
            - Working on this now...
        - Phase-bifurcation index (VanRullen)
        - Consider using Phase-consistency metric from Landau et al (2015)
    - Does low-freq phase predict power at tagged frequencies?
    - Does power at each tagged frequency vary rhythmically?
        - FFT or autocorrelation of each power time-course
    - How does power at the two tagged frequencies covary?
        - Factor out overall changes in excitability, maybe by looking at the difference between the two hemispheres?
        - Factor out broadband power?
            - Use the SNR (instantaneous) of both time courses?
        - Could test for alternation by adapting Gulbanaite & Cohen to maximize activity that discriminates the two RFT frequencies...?

- Micro-saccades?
    - Check EyeLink traces
    - Check EOG

Analyses & plots
    - Behavior
        - Target threshold changing over the experiment
        - Hits in each condition
    - Frequency tagging checks
        - Raw spectra - plot average over subjects?
        - RESS spatial filter topographies
            - Averaged over subjects
            - Plot spectra of RESS components by individual subjects
        - SNR topographies
            - Not split by side of frequency (yet)

- Artifacts
    - Go over manual artifact rejection again
        - After previous rounds (and after ICA)
    - Eye movements
-ROI
    - Start with 3 combined gradiometers (6 gradiometers) from SNR topos
    - Look at the SNR separately for L & R stimuli
    - Check whether freq tagging shows up in ICA. Start with Tjerk.
    - Look into Gulbainate and Cohen SSVEP method
    - Comparison of spatial filter methods:

        - GEDb seems to be the best, especially for shorter recordings (fig 4D)

- Analyses
    - Trials with NaN-tagged artifacts get turned into *all* NaNs after TFR calc.
        - This means very little data remains for analysis
        - Is this true for both LF and HF analyses?
        - How can we fix this?
            - Reject using 'partial' instead of 'nan'?
    - In TFR calculation, there's a warning: (one of the) axis is/are not evenly spaced, but plots are made as if axis are linear
    - Establish rhythmic sampling
        - Look into reproducing the analyses from Landau et al (2015)
        - power spectrum of RFT power (FFT on power in every trial, then average)
        - Find a way to avoid the stimulus-driven response
            - Start at 0.5 s after stim onset
            - subtract the average response
            - subtract the power at adjacent frequencies (Use SNR?)
        - Before averaging over subjects, divide out the area under the curve from 1-40 Hz
    - Does power at tagged frequencies correlate with accuracy?
        - Double-check rs_accuracy_hfpower
            - Simulate known data and make sure you can reconstruct it
    - Does low-freq phase correlate with accuracy?
        - Replicate Fiebelkorn et al (2018)
        - Phase-bifurcation index (VanRullen)
    - Does low-freq phase predict power at tagged frequencies?
    - Does power at each tagged frequency vary rhythmically?
        - FFT or autocorrelation of each power time-course
    - How does power at the two tagged frequencies covary?
        - Rerun this analysis
        - Factor out broadband power?
            - Use the SNR (instantaneous) of both time courses?
        - Could test for alternation by adapting Gulbanaite & Cohen to maximize activity that discriminates the two RFT frequencies...?

- Micro-saccades?
    - Check EyeLink traces
    - Check EOG

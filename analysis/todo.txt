    - Trials with NaN-tagged artifacts get turned into *all* NaNs after TFR calc.
    - In TFR calculation, there's a warning: (one of the) axis is/are not evenly spaced, but plots are made as if axis are linear
    - Does power at tagged frequencies correlate with accuracy?
        - Why are there so many trials with all NaNs in the trial-defined data?
        - Double-check rs_tfr_stats.
            - Simulate known data and make sure you can reconstruct it
    - Does low-freq phase correlate with accuracy?
        - Re-run LF TFRs (changed a couple parameters)
        - Replicate Fiebelkorn et al (2018)
    - Does low-freq phase predict power at tagged frequencies?
    - How does power at the two tagged frequencies covary?
        - Initial analysis: positive xcorr at t=0
        - Find a way to factor out broadband power?

- Artifacts
    - Go over manual artifact rejection again
        - After previous rounds (and after ICA)
    - Eye movements
-ROI
    - Use RESS/GEDb based on 63Hz
      - RESS/GEDb - implemented. Works well for 63 Hz, very poorly for 78 Hz due to weak signal.
      - Use spatial filters from 63 Hz for both frequencies. For participants who have clean filters for both frequencies, the filters look almost identical.
    - Comparison of spatial filter methods:

        - GEDb seems to be the best, especially for shorter recordings (fig 4D)

- Analyses
    - In TFR calculation, there's a warning: (one of the) axis is/are not evenly spaced, but plots are made as if axis are linear
    - Establish rhythmic sampling
        - power spectrum of RFT power (FFT on power in every trial, then average)
            - ** Result: Blob of low-freq power at the RFT frequency is modulated at 2 Hz. Is that just 1/f noise, and we only have enough carrier-signal power to see 1/f noise at the RFT frequencies?
        - Before averaging over subjects, divide out the area under the curve from 1-40 Hz
        - Look into reproducing the analyses from Landau et al (2015)?
    - Does power at tagged frequencies correlate with accuracy?
        - Double-check rs_accuracy_hfpower
            - Simulate known data and make sure you can reconstruct it
    - Does low-freq phase correlate with accuracy?
        - Replicate Fiebelkorn et al (2018)
        - Phase-bifurcation index (VanRullen)
        - Consider using Phase-consistency metric from Landau et al (2015)
    - Does low-freq phase predict power at tagged frequencies?
    - Does power at each tagged frequency vary rhythmically?
        - FFT or autocorrelation of each power time-course
    - How does power at the two tagged frequencies covary?
        - Factor out overall changes in excitability, maybe by looking at the difference between the two hemispheres?
        - Factor out broadband power?
            - Use the SNR (instantaneous) of both time courses?
        - Could test for alternation by adapting Gulbanaite & Cohen to maximize activity that discriminates the two RFT frequencies...?

- Micro-saccades?
    - Check EyeLink traces
    - Check EOG
